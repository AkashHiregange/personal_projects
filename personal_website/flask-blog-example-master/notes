clients: browser is an example of client; javascript is used. Data transfer through a protocol like http (hypertext
transfer protocol) Client side scripting is usually javascript

server and clients are both connected through internet

template: part of website code is present in the folder and hence a Private folder which cannot be accessed
by anyone
